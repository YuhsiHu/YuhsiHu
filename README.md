### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I received the M.Phil. degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, under the supervision of Prof. [Man-On Pun](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/simonpun/member/director_simonpun.html). Before that, I got my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering at Northwestern Polytechnical University. In addition, I had worked at [XGRIDS](https://www.xgrids.cn/) as a research intern and at [Baidu Cloud](https://cloud.baidu.com/) as a software development engineer, respectively.

- 🌱 My research interests are **3D reconstruction** and **computer vision**.
